            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>This day alſo in the ſame Towne was a mutiny made by ſome Malignants who would have had the Armes delivered to the Gentlemen, wherein one Frost a principall Malignant and a Papiſt is reported to be ſlaine.</p>
               <p>In London there was a great rumor that they were up in Armes in Kent to defend the County againſt the entrance of Prince Robert; but neither did the Prince advance that way further then Kingſton, nor did they ever put themſelves into a poſture of defence.</p>
               <p>To day there was a Poſt came from Cheſter that brought certaine newes that the Lords Juſtices of Ireland, Sir William Parſons, and Sir Iohn Borlace had inſtituted a ſolemne Faſt to be held on every Wedneſday the laſt of each Moneth in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Faſt ordained here in England by the High
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156244:3"/>Court of Parliament, the ſaid Expreſſe declaring alſo the growing miſeries of that unhappy Kingdome, and that God had pleaſed to ſhew his mercy towards them in the midſt of their miſeries, by granting a great and glorious victory to the Marqueſſe of Ormond againſt the Munſter Rebels, wherein three thouſand of them were ſlaine, and twelve hundred ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoners, with divers Prieſts and Jeſuites.</p>
               <p>From Yarmouth it is certified that the Mary Roſe, a good ſtout Ship of theirs at Sea, bound from France homeward, was ſet upon by two Pyrats men of War, with whom after a long and deſperate cruell fight, Mary Roſe ſunke one of them and layd the other aboard, which was found to be when they had taken her an Argier Veſſell laden with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, moſt of her men being Iriſh, and bound for Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven.</p>
               <p>In the City of Coventry there hapned a ſudden accident this day, ſome popiſhly affected Malignants of Stratford upon Avon, being at the Signe of the Bull at one Ellis Iones his houſe, in their cups began to ſpeake ill of the Proceedings of the Parliament. Iones being an honeſt man, and a true honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the Parliament, told them it was uncivill in them to ſpeake ill of their betters, and that for his part he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire any ſuch diſcourſe ſhould be in his houſe, at which word one of them with a Damme ſtab'd the poore man to the heart, and getting to their horſes, all of them eſcaped out of the City.</p>

Divers over preciſe Zelots in the Divine Service-time pulling the Miniſter out of his Pue, and rending off his Surplice; but by the mediation and help of ſome good religious perſons the ſaid Fray was appeaſed, the Miniſter defended from danger, and thoſe tumultuous fellowes turn'd out of the Church.</p>
               <p>This day arrived near Minehead in Sommerſet-ſhire, in a little by creeke, a Fiſher-boat with ſome Cavaliers, ſent out
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156244:3"/>of South-Wales by the Marqueſſe Hertford, with Letters to his old confederate Sir Ralph Hopton, they being in the courſe habit of Fiſhermen came to the Towne and went to a poore blinde Ale-houſe, where they luſtily carowſed, and in their drinke ſpoke divers reproachfull words againſt the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament; the Hoſt went and informed the Conſtable, who with a ſufficient guard made ſtay of them, they being foure in number, and ſearching them found their Letters; which teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied what they were: Which Letters with the ſaid Cavaliers, he cauſed to be ſafely conveyed to Taunton, where the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers are in cuſtody till further order be taken for their dipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall.</p>
               <p>In Yorke this day there was a mutiny in the Earle of Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlands Army for want of pay, plundring divers mens hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of worth in the time of Divine Service, which the ſaid Earle could not, or at leaſtwiſe would not puniſh; ſo that he and his Cavaliers are growne very odious to the Citiſens.</p>

               <p>This day an aviſo from Holland teſtified that the Queen is inſtantly to take ſhipping thence, but not as it was reported with any forces: The States being carefull leſt any detriment ſhould arrive to the kingdome of England, either by their permiſſion or furtherance.</p>
               <p>It was abſolutely certified from Exceſter, that that rich and good City had reſolved to ſend up to the Parliament a very large quantity of Plate, amounting to at leaſt 20000 l. to be ſecured them in the publicke faith for the defence of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>In Norfolke divers Malignants (as it is informed)) ſtriv'd to ſeduce the Country people Gentlemen and others, to raiſe moneyes for the ſupport, as they pretended, of the King and Proteſtant Religion; but their endeavours by the wiſedome and care of ſome well affected perſons of quality was fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, and they laid hold of, are at Norwich in ſafe cuſtody.</p>

               <p>This day the Earle of Cumberland, with ſome thouſand men, made a ſally upon Maſter Hothams trenches, but he was bravely repulſt with the loſſe of 200 of his men; our ſouldiers purſuing them to the very gates, and entred with them, had not they within diſchargeh their Ordnance, which lighted more on their owne then on our ſouldiers. It is a lamentable eſtate that flouriſhing City is reduc'd into, Wheat being already at a mark a buſhell, and the poore people ready to ſtarve; ſo that if the Earle of Newcastle relieve it not, who hath been long looked for there, but dares not come, it muſt be ſurrendred within a week at moſt.</p>
               <p>This day my Lord of Newcaſtle, with a conſiderable ſtrength of horſe and foot, came into Durham, his army being one halfe Papiſts.

               <p>THis day Letters came from Newcaſtle, that teſtified that there lately, ſince the laſt newes arriv'd there two more ſhips with Ammunition, and that the Queene is expected there daily.</p>

               <p> This day alſo it was aſſured from Exceſter, that Sir Ralph Hopton being well beaten with his Cavaliers from that City, was retir'd againe with Sir Bevil Greenvill into Cornwall.</p>
               <p>A memorable accident hapned at Norwich, certaine Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers comming into that City, and one of them drinking a health to the confuſion of the Parliament, was choak'd with his ſudden draught, and fell downe dead.</p>
               <p>Divers Cavaliers were this day brought up to Newgate, and other priſons, that were taken roming in the County of Middleſex, by ſome of his Excellence the Earle of Eſſex his forces. It was credibly reported, that the Earle of Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had proffered to deliver up the City to Sir Edw.

               <p>THis morning came out an Order and Declaration from the high Court of Parliament, inſtituting and confirming the Lord Fairſax Generall of the forces in Yorkeſhire.</p>
               <p>This day alſo were brought to towne five or ſix Cavaliers, and committed to ſafe cuſtody. There came newes to towne from Yorke, that the City was ſurrendred by the Earle of Cumberland to Maſter Hotham and the Parliaments Forces, upon what condition is not yet knowne. It was reported that the Scots in Ireland have had a great victory over Sir Philim O-Neale the arch Rebell, and that Rori Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Guire is there priſoner. It was alſo reported, that the plate which the City of Excester proffered to lend the Parliament on the publique faith, is with a ſufficient guard comming up to Guild-Hall, and is credibly believ'd, that the good Cities of Norwich and Briſtoll, in an emulous imitation of Exceſter, will alſo lend on the ſame terms good ſtore of plate to the Common-welth. Certainly it was affirmed this day, that ſome ſhips laden with ammunition were taken in the narrow ſeas, and are at Margate to come up the River.</p>
